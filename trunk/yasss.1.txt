NAME
----
YasSS - Yet another (simple|stupid) Sudoku Solver - solves and generates
Sudokus

SYNOPSIS
--------
*yasss* [-aCcgmsuv]

*yasss* -h|--help

*yasss* -V|--version

*yasss* -g|--generate[=num]

*yasss* -r|--random[=num]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
YasSSS solves Sudokus. Without any options it reads them one per line from
standard input, solves them and prints them to stanard output (in the same
format). If there are multiple solutions, only the first found is taken.

The Sudokus are read one per line, with any character other then *1*..*9*
treated as an empty cell. If the line is shorter than 81 charaters, all the
missing number are treated as empty. 

This behaviour can be modified be several options.

OPTIONS
-------
-a, --answer::
	Force the solution to be printed. When one of the '-c', '-s'-Options
	is given, the default behaviour is to supress the output of the
	solution. 
-c, --count::
	Searches for multiple solutions and prints the number of distinct
	solutions. You should note that it takes a long time if there are
	many solutions.
-C, --canonical::
	Transforms the given Sudoku to its canonical form, that means to the
	lexicographic least of all transformations that don't change the
	Sudoku's logic. This option is applied before all others.
-g, --generate[=num]::
	Generates a Sudoku, if 'num' is given, 'num' Sudokus are generated.
	The generated Sudokus typically have 27 ... 30 numbers given.
	If this option is given, all other options are ignored.
-m, --minimize::
	Delete numbers from the given Sudokus as far as possible without
	making the Sudoku ambigous 
-r, --random[=num]::
	Generates a Sudoku, if 'num' is given, 'num' Sudokus are generated.
	The generated Sudokus have a random number of initial clues.
-s, --score::
	Prints a difficulty rating for the given Sudoku. Higher numbers mean
	more difficult Sudokus. Currently this score is 1 for each missing
	number and 5 for each backtracking step taken. In this mode a more
	advanced search is disabled to obtain more acurate results.
	See section BUGS below...
-S, --svg::
	Print all Sudokus as svg files to standard output. These Sudokus are
	nicely formated. However if more then one Sudoku is printed out, you
	have to take care for yourself to split it into multiple files. 
-u, --uniq::
	Prints a message if the Sudoku has a uniq solution. This is much
	faster then --count if there are lots of solutions
-v, --verbose::
	Currently igonored

BUGS
----
	- --score option prints out somewhat arbitrary results. It's output
	depends on the number of backtracking steps taken to solve the
	Sudoku, which means that it depends on the representation given. For
	example, you can transpose a Sudoku and get a different result,
	although the transposed Sudoku follows the same logic. 
	- If called twice a microsecond it generates the same Sudoku due to the
	way the random number generator is initialized. This will not be
	fixed.
