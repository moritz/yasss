I hope I'll find the time to translate it soon.

To build yasss, you need a C++ compiler (tested with g++ 3.3.5-3).
To generate the documentation, you need a2x from the `asciidoc` package (at
least if you are using Debian ;-)), asciidoc and xsltproc.

Although file gui.cpp contains a first attempt to create a gui using gtk, you
should not try to use it. It doesn't work. Period. Propably it will never
work...
