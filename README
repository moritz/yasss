YAsSS: Yet Another Stupid Sudoku Solver
A C++ Program written by Moritz Lenz.

Algorithm: 
described at http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/yasss#algorithm

To build yasss, you need a C++ compiler (tested with g++ 3.3.5-3 and 
4.1.2 20061115).
To generate the documentation, you need a2x from the `asciidoc` package (at
least if you are using Debian ;-)), asciidoc and xsltproc.

Although file gui.cpp contains a first attempt to create a gui using gtk, you
should not try to use it. It doesn't work. Period. Propably it will never
work...
