DESCRIPTION

YasSS-curses generates a random Sudoku on startup and presents you a nice

'0', 'DEL', 'd'::
	Delete the current number.
'L'::
	Toggle the 'locked'-flag for the number under the cursor.
	Locked numbers cannot be changed and are displayed in bold white.
'H'::
	Give a hint: enter the correct number at the cursor position.
'c'::
	Check Sudoku for correctness. Displays a message if it is correct or
	not.
'C'::

BUGS
----
	- If called twice a second it generates the same Sudoku due to the
	way the random number generator is initialized
	- Wrong numbers under the cursor are not hilighted when 'C' is
	pressed.
	- Some keys are processed wrong if modifies (shift, control...) are
	pressed.
