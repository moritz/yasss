YaSSS is a fast and simplistic Sudoku Solver.
It solves all solveable Sudokus, but currently it doesn't do more.

It reads one Sudoku per line from standard input and prints out the solved Sudoku.

YaSSS is currently only tested under Linux, but migration to other platforms should be easy because it only uses standard library calls.
